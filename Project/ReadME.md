## AI Final Project Submission

### Class ID: 108168

**How we approached the Task**
By making and training to our models. We did create 6 model to check the behavior of Data Response and got different responses from them among those responses we selected the best response we got which was much accurate as compared to others and more faster in generating result.

**Which models we selected and why**
We Selected Adaptive Boosting and Decision Tree These two model were more efficient then other mostly all model generated the same result. but some of them took alot of time while in test run how ever these two model generated result more accurate yet more faster then others However Decision Tree display response even more faster than Adaptive Boosting.

**What were the performances of each model on local test data.**

##### Model 1 -> Logistic Regression

##### Model 2 -> Random Forest

##### Model 3 -> Multinomial Naive Bayes

##### Model 4 -> Decision Tree Classifier

##### Model 5 -> KNN - K Nearest Neighbors

##### Model 6 -> Adaptive Boostings

**Problem we face:**

> This task is new to us thats why we done many mistake while searching solution to a problem. Because of wrong searching we got stuck on some points for a long time.

**References we used**
We took referece and guidance from website of GeeksforGeeks, Online Blog and Youtube Videos.

**Score:**
